George beamed on top of the stage to the crowd with a huge smile on his face. Loud cheering, applause and a slow chanting of his name echoed through the sea of shiny black robes with tiny hints of gold. He motioned his hand to stop the crowd's cheer. He is ready to speak now.

*"Thank you my fellow graduates! Thank you!"*

The crowd went quiet, as if urging him to speak. Everybody loves George, he's smart and kind. He's everyone's friend. He's also this year's valedictorian.

*"It has been a long year for us and now we've finally reached the end of our journey."*

George went on with his speech talking about hard college life was for him. How he braved through exams and school activities. He went on thanking everyone who was part of his journey in school.

*"I would like to thank my schoolmates, my friends. Without them, school wouldn't be as bearable as it is."*

The crowd cheered. Everyone was his friend after all.

*"I would like to thank my parents for their undying love and support for me. All of this wouldn't have been possible without them."*

George paused for a bit. There was a hint of hesitation on his face but he went on.

*"and lastly... I would like to thank one of my teachers. The one who told me I wouldn't make it the first semester. The one who told me I will amount to nothing."*

The crowd fell silent.

*"Well, here I am Mrs. Flannery, here I am! I have proved you wrong. Everyone graduating here with me right now, proved you wrong."*

The crowd erupted with cheers. George ended his speech and on that note the ceremonial rites were over. Everyone shook everyone's hands, it was a celebration.

The parking lot was empty except for Mrs. Flannery. Her car keys were slipping from her hands as she's trying to enter her old, beat-up suburban. Her hands were sweaty, probably because nobody shook them.

Mrs. Flannery arrived at her empty apartment aparently a little shaken but still composed. All these years of teaching had made her an emotional rock.

*I'm proud of you George. I knew you had it in you. You were just a little lazy. I knew your potential from the very first day of school. You just needed motivation. You needed a push. I'm proud of you. I'm really proud of everyone.*

Mrs. Flannery doesn't believe in spoon feeding her students. She wants everyone to work for their achievements and not have their diplomas just being handed out to them. She did everyone a favor on her expense, and it looks like she succeeded.

Mrs. Flannery walks to her desk, and turns on her lamp. She takes a seat and her cat jumps on her lap. She takes out her pen and her notebook. It's time to plan for the next school year.
