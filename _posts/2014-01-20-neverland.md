I can hear the steady beeping of the machines, see the flickering lights and hear the sound of air pumping. It’s like an orchestra of machines playing the symphony of life.

Peter was always a sickly child. He never had the chance to go out and play as much like all the other kids his age do. Normally you would see Peter sitting behind his window looking outside, seemingly lost in his own thoughts.

Peter may have been sheltered, he may have not explored the world as he should have, but boy, his imagination took him to places he can never go on foot. Peter was a creative child. His mind was his playground and his creativity was the limit.

I remember the time he told me about this place he had been to, I just can’t remember what he called it. A place of magic and adventure, a place of magical forests, pirate treasures and fairies. A place where every child wants to go. A place where you can do anything you like, eat anything you want. He even told me he could fly with just a happy thought. A place where time doesn’t exist and no one ever grows old. Peter’s stories were so detailed and specific, I swear I almost believed him.

I’ve been taking care of Peter ever since I found him in an empty alley and brought him to the orphanage. I’ve always wondered how a mother can leave a child like that.

Because of Peter’s condition, he really wasn’t able to make a lot of friends. I remember the day when Wendy and her young brothers John and Michael came to the orphanage. You can see the sadness and confusion in their eyes. Their parents died in an accident and they had nowhere else to go, no one in their extended family wanted to take them. Peter was the first one to talk to them and make them feel welcome. They’ve been friends ever since.

Every day Wendy and her brothers would come visit Peter in his room and they would listen to all his stories. I would join in too, of course. They can’t have all the fun all to themselves.

It wasn’t all rainbows and sunshine for us in the orphanage. Every 12th of the month, people, couples, would come in to the orphanage and get kids for adoption. Everyone would be up and ready by 4 o’clock in the morning. Mr. Hook, the oprphanage headmaster, would come and inspect all of us to see if we’re ready for our potential “parents”. While it was easy for young ones to get adopted, it is not the case for us who are older. I guess belonging in a family would never really happen to us. No one wants an older kid, and no one wants a sickly child even more.

There was something weird about the noises these machines are making. I’ve been with Peter for two weeks and this is the first time they’ve been acting this way. I’m nowhere near a doctor, but I could definitely tell something is wrong.

I call the head nurse’s office and tell them about the situation. *“We’ll be there right away Miss Bell!”*. I notice a hint of panic in her voice and I can hear them calling for the doctor in the background.

The doctor and his group of nurses enter the room in a matter of seconds. They immediately surround Peter and mutter words I can barely understand.

I didn’t notice that tears have been rolling down my face for quite some time. I was too focused on Peter.

The machine gave a steady, high pitched sound.

*“We’ve done everything that we can.”*

*“We’re so sorry.”*

I walk over to Peter and it’s almost as if he’s still sleeping. He looks calm and happy. I can see a tiny smile on his face. I give him one last kiss on his cheek. He’s finally there at that place. A place where every kid wants to be. A place of magic and adventure, a place of magical forests, pirate treasures and fairies. I remember it now, it was Neverland.

I watched [Hook](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102057/) when I was bored and was looking for random channels on the TV. I guess you can say that I was hooked! YEAAAAAAH

“I do belive in fairies! I do, I do, I do!”
