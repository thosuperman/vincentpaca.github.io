It has been a long day for Rachel. As she was removing her coat, her shoes and her gloves, she paused for a moment and thought about how much she hated that diner along with everyone in it. She just let out a deep sigh. She just got home in time for supper. Tonight is the night. She’ll do anything just to get by. She’ll do anything just to get her _fix_.

It has been five years since the outbreak. The city and the people have never been the same after that. People have been quite... _distant_ with each other.

The government has implemented a law banning prolonged physical contact between humans. This includes hugging, holding hands and all other forms of human intimacy. It was believed that the epidemic spread because of the human touch.

_The streets sure are cold this time of the night_, Rachel thought to herself as she’s walking on the pavement three blocks away from home, occasionally looking behind to see if someone’s following her. As she reaches the corner, she pulls out a piece of torn paper from her coat. _6th street_, the handwriting says. She takes a deep breath and a swift look to the empty street before she enters the dark alley.

_These meeting places are getting harder to find_, she said to herself. These “dealers” are always on the run from the police, they have to change their location twice a week. Rachel just shrugs it off and thinks that it is worth it. She _needs_ it.

She reaches the end of the alley with a door slightly ajar. She gives it a slight nudge and she’s greeted with a nice, warm feeling, reminding her of fresh toast and a hot chocolate on a Sunday morning. A stranger comes up to her and greets her with a big hug. She was taken aback for a moment but the surprise on her face was overtaken by her smile.

These intimate conventions happen right under the noses of those in power. It’s human nature to long for the touch and the warmth of another and people are going to do whatever it takes, even if it means breaking the law.

The stranger holds her hand and pulls her to a bigger room. Here she sees people from all walks of life. She doesn’t know any of them but she surely does recognize some familiar faces. Rachel has been going to these small gatherings for three weeks now. The room was loud and happy. She was happy. She was finally _home_.

Time was moving too fast she didn’t want that moment to end. _There surely were a lot of hugs given tonight_, Rachel thought to herself with a smile. The walk back home seemed shorter for her. She reaches her apartment door still with a smile on her face. _This should get me through another week_, she goes thinking as she removes her shoes and her coat. There was no need for gloves this time.
